# NFL_Groupme_Bot

Groupme bot to track our NFL team bet. Bot can be called in groupme with 'colts suck'. Since the only objective was to keep track for our specific use case, most of the code is hard-coded. I recommend checking out Trent_Bot below for ideas on how to add further commands. 

For further info on bot creating, see [Trent_Bot](https://github.com/trentprynn/TrentBot) and [AP_Norton_24_Hour_GroupMe_Bot](http://www.apnorton.com/blog/2017/02/28/How-I-wrote-a-Groupme-Chatbot-in-24-hours/)
